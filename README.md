- From the analysis Pewlett-Hackard is going to have a large number of Senior Engineers and Senior Staff retiring. 

- It would be a good idea to utilize the mentorship eligible employees to start a formalized mentorship program so they can start training the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard Senior Engineers and Senior Staff.

- Pewlett-Hackard should be prioritizing the hiring of junior to mid-level engineers so they can step up once the "silver tsunami" occurs.

-  Pewlett-Hackard might take this opportunity to look at downsizing certain business areas to become more efficient.
downsizing certain business areas to shed expenses, look for efficiencies and potentially re-focus on core mission. 


## Summary:


How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- There are 90,398 retirement eligible employees. I would recommend Pewlett-Hackard do further analysis into which departments have the most amount of employees retiring to address hiring needs. 


Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- There are 1,550 mentorship eligible employees, and 90,398 retirement eligible employees. No, there are not enough existing employees to mentor the next generation. 

### Additional Questions/Queries:

- Pewlett-Hackard might consider sending out a survey to retirement eligible employees to for more data on the timeline's in which employees actually intend to retire. Just because an employee is retirement eligible doesn't mean they will retire, the data from this survey will help with workforce planning. 
- Pewlett-Hackard should consider which projects/skill sets are no longer needed in the future. If a project or skillset will no longer be needed in the next 5 years it might be an opportunity to cut unneeded expenses. 
- I would recommend looking at the from_date category for mentorship eligibility, if someone hasn't been an engineer for long they may not be ready to mentor junior engineers.
